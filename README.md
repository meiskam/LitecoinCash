What is Litecoin-cash?
----------------

Litecoin-cash(LCH) is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Litecoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.
Litecoin-cash supports SegWit and 8MB block-sizes to improve on-chain scalability, adds new smart contract features and plans to support the Lightning Network.
For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of the Litecoin Core software, see https://litecoin.org.
